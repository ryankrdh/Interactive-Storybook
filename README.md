## Project Summary:
Created a Tic Tac Toe game using JavaScript, showcasing proficiency in front-end web development and problem-solving skills. The game allows you to play against an AI to take turns marking X and O on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. Implemented logic to validate moves, check for win conditions, and handle game outcomes. Demonstrated understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build an interactive and user-friendly gaming experience. Utilized object-oriented programming principles to structure the code and maintain modularity.

## Key Features:
* **JavaScript Mastery:** The project showcases my expertise in JavaScript, employing modern ES6+ features and understanding behind-the-scenes concepts like the event loop, hoisting, and scoping.
  
* **Game Logic:** I have implemented the complete game logic, allowing players to interact with the command-line interface and enjoy seamless gameplay against the AI.
  
* **AI using Minimax Algorithm:** The AI player is powered by the powerful Minimax algorithm, ensuring challenging gameplay and intelligent moves by the AI opponent. 

* **User Interaction:** The command-line interface provides an intuitive experience for players to make their moves and witness the AI's moves in real-time. 

* **Winning Detection and Visualization:** The project includes a winning combination detection algorithm that accurately identifies the winner and visually highlights the winning line on the board using SVG. 

* **Modularity and Organization:** I have designed the codebase with a focus on modularity and organization, promoting code readability and maintainability.

* **Error Handling and Game State Management:** Robust error handling ensures smooth gameplay, while proper game state management allows for game restarts and tracking the state of the board. 

* **Version Control:** The project is hosted on GitHub, reflecting my proficiency in version control and collaborative development practices. 


## How to use

The player has HP and Energy. When taking damage from battles, the energy will drain first before the HP.

The player and all the animals will have their own HP and attack power.

The player is able to 'pick up' Actions to use later.

The game is saved in the local storage to be continued later.
